# Expense Tracker Deployment Guide

## Firebase Security Rules Setup

To secure your application, you need to deploy the Firebase security rules:

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in your project** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   firebase init firestore
   ```

4. **Deploy the security rules**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## Vercel Deployment

The application is already configured for Vercel deployment with the `vercel.json` file.

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix major functionality and security issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically deploy on push to main branch

## Environment Variables

Make sure your Firebase configuration is properly set up in `src/firebaseConfig.ts`.
